    """
    Using Shamir's secret sharing protocol, creates shares for the secret.
    pycryptodome's Shamir.split requires the secret to be of length
    SECRET_CHUNK_LENGTH. Since the secret length cannot always be set to be
    SECRET_CHUNK_LENGTH, we split the secret byte string into multiple byte
    string each of length SECRET_CHUNK_LENGTH and create shares for each of
    the SECRET_CHUNK_LENGTH chunks.
    During reconstruction, the SECRET_CHUNK_LENGTH chunks are recreated using
    the respective shares and then concatenated to form the original secret.
    Thus each of the collaborator indices have multiple shares (one for each
    chunk) for a single secret.

    Args:
        secret (bytes): Secret for which shares are to be created.
        count (int): Number of shares to be created for the secret.
        threshold (int): Minimum threshold of shares required for
            reconstruction of the secret.

    Returns:
        dict: Contains the mapping of the index to the shares that belong to
            the respective index.
